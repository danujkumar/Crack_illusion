- PS1: Enhancing Flight Navigation Mechanism for Optimal Route Planning and Risk Mitigation

- Overview: We have developed a Next.js web application dashboard for pilots and technical heads, allowing them to visualize and respond to our backend algorithm for optimal route planning. We use the Leaflet framework for map visualization and have implemented our REST APIs on a Node server.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** NextJs, TailwindCSS, NextUI

**Map:** React Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, Maptiler, leaflet-draw

**Server:** Node, Express

**Database** MongoDB


## Run Locally

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## Environment Variables

- The API can be used on any platform, including web and mobile applications.
- To run the frontend, a browser is required.
- Our REST API provides an array of coordinates for planned routes and calculated data
